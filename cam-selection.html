<title>Cam Selection</title>
<body>

<p>How much surging are you willing to put up with in low gears / at low speeds? 
<br>That will indicate how much overlap you can tolerate.

<p>How high of an RPM are you willing to tolerate before the engine makes real power?
<br>That will indicate the intake valve closing angle.

<p>How often are you willing to change valve springs?
<br>That will indicate how much lift you should run.

<p>"Influence" might be a better word than "indicate" but these are the primary factors in cam selection, and how they affect the cam specs. If you're not thinking / discussing in these terms you're basically just rolling the dice. Everybody has their own idea of what constitutes a good cam for a particular usage scenario.
